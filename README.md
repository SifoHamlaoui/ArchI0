### ./How the Script works ? 
   * [Full Explanation](https://pastebin.com/raw/7XiBkskg)

### ./How do i got the idea ? 
   From KAAISv3 script And Big thank To the developer

### ./How did I choose the Applications ? 

   i got the Applications from {Archlinux ALL APPLICATIONS List } { Gnome Applications} {KDE Applications } { XFCE Applications }
   
### ./How i organise them and execute them ?
### 1. First before adding the program i check it first , i install it on my laptop and try it ( if there is no bugs or errors ) 

### 2. I Add the program to the list and add its own installation function
 
### 3. I google the program for some short descriptions

### 4. I add the program installation command + short descriptions + shorted link to the website or full documentation of the program
   
### ./Why Using Shorted Links? 
Yeah, i use it to see how much people are downloading and caring about my script ,  you can check it or scan it or do whatever you want.
   
### ./why all of those commands at the beggining of the script ? 

the commands are here : https://pastebin.com/raw/Ss2K36s2 .
Or you can check them on the script directly

1st one => to download figlet , cuz the script logo is shown using figlet 

2nd one => leafpad to open the License File : https://github.com/SifoHamlaoui/ArchI0/License

3rd one => installing wget to download the required files from sourceforge

4th and 5th one => to download and open the License File on leafpad

6th one to remove the License File After Reading it 

### ./why archicheck function ? 

Yeah , cuz Arch Linux x64 Architecture Need the multilab activated on the pacman.conf file 
   , to install some softwares like skype .... .
   and for installing yaourt :D The Best part of the party :D ( To use the Arch User Repo , AUR )
   
### ./Why installing the script ? 
To Skip The Commands everytime ,and use it directly from the terminal by typing 'ArchI0'.
   it's your choice to install it or not     
   
### ./why executing as ROOT ? 

the script need's the root privileges to install and make the updates for the softwares

### ./Why Using 2 Scripts ? { ArchI0live And ArchI0 }
Yeah , the live one is to use it without installation { in this case } the script will install the required programs
and ask for the script installation { in case you change your mind }
  
### PS : In The ArchI0live I removed The First Commands cuz if some one installed the script means the required programs are already installed , so no need to REinstall them. That's it  , The choice is yours

## ./Why making this script ? 

### 1- First , my goal is to add this script to the official Archlinux Distro , Waiting Dreams to become TRUE

### 2- 2ndly , cuz i'm an ArchLinux User And i was noob user also , I got lot of problems and difficults on installing programs and tools , so why not making a life-easier tool for the Archlinux users.

### ./What Are the Features of this script ?
1-  Easy To use 
2- Have 90 Easy-to-install Arch Linux Programs on 8 Categories

## ./How can You help me ?
