# ArchI0 2.2
> ArchI0 : ArchLinux Applications Automatic Installation Script
## ArchI0 2.2 is OUT! ,check <a href="release_notes.md">The release notes</a> to see what is NEW .

Install scripts can be super useful for rapid deployment of custom systems , So this script is meant to help users install their favourite applications on a fresh install of ArchLinux , Saving time to use it. On this script I added the most-used/frequent softwares used by the Archlinux Community.
(Thanks to the KAAIS script developer)

## Installation


```sh
git clone https://github.com/SofianeHamlaoui/ArchI0.git && cd ArchI0
chmod +x ./ArchI0.sh
./ArchI0.sh
```

## How ?
* Applications :  

`
I got the Applications from {Archlinux ALL APPLICATIONS List } { Gnome Applications} {KDE Applications } { XFCE Applications } , I added the most used applications after checking the dailyused apps Archlinux users like.
`

* Installation : 

`
You can install 20 apps using yaourt ( from AUR ) and 70 using pacman ( total of 90 )
`

## Why ?


* Achicheck function  :


`To enable the multilib repositories on the pacman.conf file , so you can run 32 bit applications on your x86_64 system ( wine , skype .... )`


* Installing the script : 


`To use ArchI0 from terminal directly with the command 'ArchI0' `

* Executing as ROOT : 

`The script need's the root privileges to install and make the updates for the softwares`


* This script ? 

`
As an ArchLinux user . I got lot of problems and difficults on installing programs and tools on my first time using ArchLinux , so why not making a life-easier tool for the Archlinux users <3 .
